# NOTES
# import matplotlib works once all the above de[endencies are resolved.
# did selective testing. For full testing need to setup virtualenv and
# git checkout which does not really tests a current distro. See
# https://matplotlib.org/stable/devel/testing.html for details.
# For tests:
# (1) load python module,
# (2) from source distro extract lib/matplotlib/tests/, lib/mpl_toolkits/tests/ and pytest.ini
#     to a separate location,
# (3) run  selective tests via commands like:
#     python -m  pytest lib/matplotlib/tests/test_ttconv.py
# The output suggests tests did not get updated  per latest code changes
# as require modules for import do not exists in the current matplotlib distro.
# Some tests succeed some fail with internal matplotlib errors.
# One of the full test dependencies is inkscape which itself has a big number of
# dependencies https://inkscape.org/develop/getting-started/#building-inkscape-linux
# and was not built on CentOS.

  description: |
    Traitlets {{version}} is a pure Python library. Its implementation relies on
    the descriptor pattern, and it is a lightweight pure-python alternative
    of the traits library. Traitlets powers the configuration system of
    IPython and Jupyter and the declarative API of IPython interactive
    widgets.  See https://github.com/ipython/traitlets

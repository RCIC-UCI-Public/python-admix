  description: |
    Pickleshare {{version}} is a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency support
    Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. Unlike
    shelve, many processes can access the database simultaneously. Changing a
    value in database is immediately visible to other processes accessing the
    same database. See https://github.com/pickleshare/pickleshare

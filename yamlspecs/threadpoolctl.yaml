    Threadpoolctl {{version}} Python helpers to limit the number of threads used in the
    threadpool-backed of common native libraries used for scientific computing and
    data science (e.g. BLAS and OpenMP). Fine control of the underlying thread-pool
    size can be useful in workloads that involve nested parallelism so as to mitigate
    oversubscription issues

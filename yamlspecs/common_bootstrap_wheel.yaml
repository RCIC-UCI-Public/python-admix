# For installing from wheel files for packages where current combination
# of setuptools+distutils does not work for regular build

# Overrides the definition of pip in common_wheel to use the bundled,
# but uninstalled, pip wheel file of the base distro.

# This solves the "bootstrap" build problem of circular dependency 
# pip requires tomli AND tomli can only use pip to install itself
#

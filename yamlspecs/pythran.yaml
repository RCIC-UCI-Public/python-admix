    Pythran {{version}} is an ahead of time compiler for a subset of the Python language,
    with a focus on scientific computing. It takes a Python module annotated with a
    few interface descriptions and turns it into a native Python module with the same
    interface, but (hopefully) faster. It is meant to efficiently compile scientific
    programs, and takes advantage of multi-cores and SIMD instruction units
  pymod_requires:

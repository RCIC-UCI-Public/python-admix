    Packaging {{version}} is core utilities for various Python Packaging
    interoperability specifications. This library provides utilities
    that implement the interoperability specifications which have
    clearly one correct behaviour (eg. PEP 440) or benefit greatly
    from having a single shared implementation (eg. PEP 425).

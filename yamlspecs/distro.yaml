  description: |
    Distro {{version}} provides information about the OS distribution it runs on, such as
    a reliable machine-readable ID, or version information.  It is the recommended
    replacement for Python's original platform.linux_distribution function (removed
    in Python 3.8). It also provides much more functionality which isn't necessarily
    Python bound, like a command-line interface. See https://pypi.org/project/distro/

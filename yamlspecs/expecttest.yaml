  description: |
    Expecttest {{version}} is a  library that implements expect tests (also known as "golden" tests).
    Expect tests are a method of writing tests where instead of hard-coding the expected output of a test,
    you run the test to get the output, and the test framework automatically populates the expected output
  install:
    makeinstall: pip install --root $(ROOT) --no-deps ../{{src_tarball}}

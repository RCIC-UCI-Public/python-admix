    Dill {{version}} extends python's pickle module for serializing and 
    de-serializing python objects to the majority of the built-in python
    types. Serialization is the process of converting an object to a byte
    stream, and the inverse of which is converting a byte stream back to
    on python object hierarchy. See https://pypi.org/project/dill

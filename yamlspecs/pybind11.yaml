  description: |
    pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python 
    and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code.
    This compact implementation was possible thanks to some of the new C++11 language 
    features, specifically,  tuples, lambda functions and variadic templates). Since 
    its creation, this library has grown beyond Boost.Python in many ways, leading to 
    dramatically simpler binding code in many common situations.

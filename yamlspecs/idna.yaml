  description: |
    Support for the Internationalised Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) protocol as specified in RFC 5891. 
    This is the latest version of the protocol and is sometimes referred to as \"IDNA 2008\". This library
    also provides support for Unicode Technical Standard 46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing. This
    acts as a suitable replacement for the \"encodings.idna\" module that comes with the Python standard 
    library, but only supports the old, deprecated IDNA specification (RFC 3490)
